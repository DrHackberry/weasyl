def test_parse_blacklist_tags():
    """
    Ensure that ``searchtag.parse_blacklist_tags() functions as expected.

    Additionally tests ``_SEARCHTAG_BLACKLIST_REGEXP_PATTERN`` as a consequence
      of testing this function.

    Valid patterns include:
        - test*     (Wildcard at the end);
        - *test     (Wildcard at the start);
        - te*st     (Wildcard in the middle);
        - test      (A raw tag with no wildcard); and
        - test_too  (Underscores are also permitted)

    Invalid patterns include:
        - *             (No raw wildcards)
        - a* or *a      (Must have at least two alphanumeric characters with a wildcard)
        - a*a*, *a*a, *aa*, or a**a  (Only one asterisk per tag)
        - Anything that does not meet the same requirements of ``searchtag.parse_tags()``, 
            since this function essentially reimplements and extends that function.
            Example, unicode characters.
